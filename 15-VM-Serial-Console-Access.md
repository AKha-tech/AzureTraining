#  Azure - Serial Console

## Purpose

At the end of this module, you will:
* Learn how to have direct serial-based access to Linux or Windows machines.

## Serial Console access

Managing and running virtual machines can be hard. Azure offer extensive tools to help you manage and secure your VMs, including patching management, configuration management, agent-based scripting, automation, SSH/RDP connectivity, and support for DevOps tooling like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. However, we have learned from many of you that sometimes this isnâ€™t enough to diagnose and fix issues. Maybe a change you made resulted in an fstab error on Linux and you cannot connect to fix it. Maybe a bcdedit change you made pushed Windows into a weird boot state. Now, you can debug both with direct serial-based access and fix these issues with the tiniest of effort. It's like having a keyboard plugged into the server in our datacenter but in the comfort of your office or home.
